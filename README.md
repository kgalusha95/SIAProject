# SIAProject
An Assembler and Virtual machine written in C. This project takes an assembly language
called SIA (Simple Instruction Architecture) and converts it to machine code using the
assembler. The output from the assembler can be used to as input for the Virtual machine.
The virtual machine is able to execute and provide output for the machine code.
